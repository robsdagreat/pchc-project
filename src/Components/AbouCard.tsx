          Pallotti Children Hope Centre is a boarding Centre for Children with autism,
          mild and moderate Intellectual Disabilities. The Centre, which is the first of its kind in Rwanda,
          is founded by a German organization known as Wir FÃ¼r Ruanda. This organization realized,
          through Dr. Bernd BIERBUM, how marginalized and excluded children with intellectual disabilities were,
          and still are, from many services being enjoyed by other members of society.
